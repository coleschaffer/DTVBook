<p class="no-indent-caps">THIS IS A PORTRAIT OF DON VALENTINE AND THE ROOTS AND BEGINNINGS OF SEQUOIA.</p>
<br />
<p>Don was born at a time when veterans of America's Civil War were still alive. When he entered the U.S. Army in 1954, there was not a satellite in the sky. In the early 1960s, when he moved to Northern California, American schools regularly conducted drills for nuclear attacks and millions of African-Americans were still prevented from voting. Don began his fulltime investment career at the start of 1972, just before Richard Nixon flew to China to begin a relationship with Chairman Mao.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This is about an era during which almost all technology companies of merit were formed in the United States; when women, unfortunately, played a minor role in Silicon Valley; when it was very expensive to start a company and before Sequoia had even contemplated doing business in China or India or South-east Asia or forming Sequoia Heritage, Sequoia Capital Global Equities, or a Global Growth Fund (let alone RMB funds, Surge, AMP or Base Camp). This is a sketch of the first chapter of Sequoia, which ended in 1996, but without which none of us would have enjoyed all the goodness that has come our way or be doing what we now do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In 1986, the year I joined Sequoia (which, I'm afraid, now makes me the longest serving member of our business), almost half of the people who today work in our Menlo Park office had yet to be born. So bear with me. Some of this may seem arcane or closer to Babylonian times than 2020. But beyond the portrait of Don, I hope you find some relevant nuggets because, while the scenery, the venues, and the cast of characters have changed, the essence of investing and teamwork remain the same. I hope you also understand that while Don penned our first chapter, great organizations only thrive if later generations contine the story while having the humility to grasp that their contributions too will eventually fade.</p>
<p class="no-indent-caps">THIS IS DON AND THIS IS HOW SEQUOIA BEGAN.</p>
